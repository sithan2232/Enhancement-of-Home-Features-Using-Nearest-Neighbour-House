## Abstract<br>
  To predict house prices, we must study and understand its historical data, statistics, and trends. Due to the difficulty of data collection, many applications employ insufficient quantities of house features (house characteristics) and fail to accurately predict house prices. The house features augmentation is a crucial aspect of house prediction applications. In the proposed project, I use machine learning techniques, including FNN and LSTM, to predict future house prices. However, rather than using only its own house features as input for the model, I augment the number of house features by including the surrounding house features. The K-nearest neighbor (brute force), LAESA, and KD-Tree approaches are regarded as the three primary methods for locating the nearest neighbor house. Both machine learning models are then constructed and evaluated using back testing and rolling window analysis. The results indicate that increasing a house's features by its adjacent house's features improves the machine learning model's performance by nearly twice across a variety of evaluation techniques, such as R2 score, MAE, and MAPE.
